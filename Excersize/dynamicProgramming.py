# Here is the real time scenario for Dynamic Programming.
# A classic example of an optimization problem involves making change using the fewest coins.
# Suppose you are a programmer for a vending machine manufacturer. Your company wants to streamline effort
# by giving out the fewest possible coins in change for each transaction. Suppose a customer puts in a
#  dollar bill and purchases an item for 37 cents. What is the smallest number of coins you can use to
# make change? The answer is six coins: two quarters, one dime, and three pennies. How did we arrive at
# the answer of six coins? We start with the largest coin in our arsenal (a quarter) and use as many of
#  those as possible, then we go to the next lowest coin value and use as many of those as possible.
