# In Python 2, the default print is a simple IO method that doesn't give many options to play around with.
#
# The following two examples will summarize it.
#
# Example 1:
#
# var, var1, var2 = 1,2,3
# print var
# print var1, var2
# Prints two lines and, in the second line, var1var1 and var2var2 are separated by a single space.
#
# Example 2:
#
# for i in xrange(10):
#     print i,
# Prints each element separated by space on a single line. Removing the comma at the end will print each element on a new line.
#
# Let's import the advanced print_function from the __future__ module.
#
# Its method signature is below:
#
# print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout)
# Here, you can add values separated by a comma. The arguments sep, end, and file are optional, but they can prove helpful in formatting output without taking help from a string module.
#
# The argument definitions are below:
# sep defines the delimiter between the values.
# end defines what to print after the values.
# file defines the output stream.
#
# Interesting, isn't it?
#
# Task
# Read an integer NN.
#
# Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
#
# 1,2,3.....N1,2,3.....N
#
# Note that "....." represents the values in between.
#
# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer NN.
#
# Output Format
# Output the answer as explained in the task.
#
# Sample Input
#
# 3
# Sample Output
#
# 123
# Pro Tip
# You can use the print function inside a map(). Can you do a 11 line code to solve the problem above?

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
