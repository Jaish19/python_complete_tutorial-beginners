# 3<len(S)<104
#
#
# Output Format
#
#
# Print the three most common characters along with their occurrence count each on a separate line.
#  Sort output in descending order of occurrence count.
#  If the occurrence count is the same, sort the characters in ascending order.

# Sample Input
#
# aabbbccde

# Sample Output
#
# b 3
# a 2

# 3
#  distinct characters.

for k,v in sorted( Counter(input()).most_common(3) , key = lambda x: (-x[1],x[0])):

# Solution 2:

userInput = list(str(input()))
for key, countValue in dict(Counter(userInput)).items():
    print(key, countValue)
